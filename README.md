# Code_Complexity

## Overview

Analyzing time complexity is crucial for writing efficient and scalable code. Traditional LeetCode-like platforms require multiple test cases to estimate time complexity, but our project eliminates this need. Instead, it leverages the Groq API to analyze code logic and structure directly. The system features a Django backend for processing user queries and a LeetCode-like frontend for an intuitive user experience.
